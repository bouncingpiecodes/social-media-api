# social-media-api

## Description of the app:
The social media API program is a Node.js server-side application that runs a Mongo NoSQL database containing data for a social media platform. The program uses the Mongoose package for object modeling and communicating with the database, and the Express package for routing. The app is all back-end and I used insomnia for testing and using seed data.
